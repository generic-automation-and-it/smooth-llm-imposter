# DOMAIN_AGENTS.md

## TL;DR

Pure domain model — entities, aggregate roots, and value objects. Zero external dependencies and no I/O.

## Non-Negotiables

- **No outward dependencies.** Domain references no other project and no infrastructure packages (EF Core, ASP.NET, HTTP, serialization). It is the innermost Clean Architecture layer — everything depends on it, it depends on nothing.
- **No I/O or framework concerns.** No persistence, network, logging, or DI registration here — those belong in Infrastructure/Host.
- **Enforce invariants at construction.** Guard required state in constructors/factory methods so an entity cannot exist in an invalid state. Value objects are immutable and compared by value.
